      Interdisciplinary Center for Water Research (ICWaR), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore organised a one-week workshop titled “Monsoon School on Urban Floods” during 07 – 12 August, 2023. The Monsoon School was funded by the research project titled, “National Supercomputing Mission”, sponsored by Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India. The Monsoon School comprised of lectures and tutorials by experts, covering topics of urban meteorology, urban hydrology, radar and remote sensing analysis of rain events, monsoon and extreme precipitation dynamics, urban groundwater, engineering practices and post-flood responses. Group discussions were arranged to bring out the relevance of the state-of-the-art tools and methodologies for managing urban floods in Indian cities in a rapid assessment scenario. The Monsoon School target participants included practicing engineers and young researchers working with government or private bodies and educational institutes.

    s in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.1<br>~ Archit
