      <h2>Soil Temperature Monitoring System (STMS)</h2>
      <p>The value of soil moisture measurement in many research, industrial and agricultural fields are necessary for managing water resources effectively. However, collecting data from the field is time-consuming and can be expensive. To automate data collection and data logging, a system was developed using the proven Watermark solid state, electric resistance type sensor and cellular network and internet database real-time monitoring. Now, the STMS can wirelessly download data from soil moisture and temperature sensors directly into your computer from any part of the world.</p>

      <h2>Cluster</h2>
      <p>ICWaR has deployed a computer cluster to improve performance and availability over that of a single computer, while typically being much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability. This is used by students for the efficient results.</p>
