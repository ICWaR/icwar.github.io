      details:"Interdisciplinary Center for Water Research (ICWaR), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bengaluru organised a one-week workshop titled “Monsoon School on Urban Floods” during 07 – 12 August, 2023. The Monsoon School was funded by the research project titled, “National Supercomputing Mission”, sponsored by Department of Science & Technology (DST), Government of India. The Monsoon School comprised of lectures and tutorials by experts, covering topics of urban meteorology, urban hydrology, radar and remote sensing analysis of rain events, monsoon and extreme precipitation dynamics, urban groundwater, engineering practices and post-flood responses. Group discussions were arranged to bring out the relevance of the state-of-the-art tools and methodologies for managing urban floods in Indian cities in a rapid assessment scenario. The Monsoon School target participants included practicing engineers and young researchers working with government or private bodies and educational institutes. Venue for the Lectures and Tutorials: Lecture Hall, Interdisciplinary Center for Water Research (ICWaR) Overview of the event: The event consisted of 39 participants from India and neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan.

Srinivas, Dr. Rajarshi Das Bhowmik, Dr. Shubha Avinash and Dr. Sanskriti Mujumdar delivered lectures on different topics related to urban floods. The participants of the workshop came from different backgrounds. Young faculty members, research scholars from different educational institutes not limited to various NITs and IITs ; Scientists/ Researchers/Project associates from Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) , Bihar Mausham Seva Kendra (BMSK), Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA), Govt. of Nepal, Govt. of Srilanka and practitioners from NGO’s and private organizations joined the Monsoon School. The participants were further divided to 7 versatile groups that helped to develop a very dynamic learning process to address issues related to floods for 7 different cities in India with history of recent floods through the workshop. Each day of the Monsoon School was divided into two sessions. In the morning sessions, lectures were conducted and in the afternoon sessions: tutorials, short assignments on the topics covered were given, group discussions were arranged etc. A visit to Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) was organized on 10th August, 2023 in the afternoon session of the workshop. All the participants visited KSNDMC where the officials described the functioning of disaster and specifically the flood early warning systems, telemetric rain gauges and other weather monitoring instruments to the participants.",
