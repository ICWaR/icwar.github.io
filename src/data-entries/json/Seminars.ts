He is currently a member of ESA’s most high level advisory body the Advisory Committee for Earth Observation and a member of the European Space Science Committee.',
        Abstract:'Many consider the launch of GRACE as marking a landmark in satellite geodetic observations of critical  climate processes. In reality, satellite geodesy has been advancing our understanding of climate-critical processes since at least the launch of Seasat in 1978, a mission that infamously only lasted 100 days but which transformed our ability to observe ocean circulation, mesoscale eddies and began the record of radar altimeter measurements over the ice sheets. Another milestone was the launch of ERS-1 in 1991, heralding the start of routine observations of millimetric-level surface displacements via SAR interferometry (InSAR), and unprecedented accuracy elevation measurements of the oceans and ice sheets. Here, I consider how this trinity of technological advances—satellite gravimetry, radar and laser altimetry and InSAR– have revolutionised our understanding of mass movement at the surface of the Earth, focusing on recent insights we have made on data-driven solutions for Glacial Isostatic Adjustment, tackling the Terrestrial Water Storage budget Grand Challenge, global water stress trends, closing the Sea Level Budget at the basin scale and global ice mass trends. I will conclude by considering the future of satellite geodesy as a tool for climate science in the context of recent and planned missions such as NISAR, SWOT, Harmony and MAGIC.',

        Abstract:'AgriFood Systems are at risk today, not just from the availability per capita, but also appropriate availability. There is a global and local narrative around the aspect of ‘Sustainability’, in simple terms, if the AgriFood System can withstand multiple crises and yet last for the subsequent generations ahead. On one hand, the problem appears to be plenty, with more food retail booming in India, at large, and on the other where health crises are proportionate levels are also increasing. From an Urban perspective it all looks fine whereas in the rural areas there still exist challenges of equity and fairness to be resolved. Climate change exists or it does not- depending on perspectives, however, to a small farmer it is a matter of life-continuity be it through daily wages, remunerative returns from agriculture or the choice of abandoning it for other avenues. All such challenges are being addressed through an appropriate understanding of Sustainability in Agriculture built upon the production system based on Natural Farming. Innovation is the key where no such precedence exists to bring participatory social change with the government intervention in Himachal Pradesh. There are 3 infrastructures being designed to address the systemic issues of Sustainability (ecological, economic and social)- these are Institutional, Digital and Physical. Innovations in each of these infrastructure paves a way for system wide changes through appropriate market access for smallholder Natural Farmers. It is the first time such a platform is being put to execution in India, the outcome of SuSPNF shall also provide a future pathway for other such innovations to address the aspect of Sustainability in AgriFood Systems in India.',

        DateTime:'24 July 2024 (Wednesday), 04:00 pm',
        Platform:'MS Teams',
        AboutSpeaker:'Kanishka Mallick is a Sr. Lead R&T Scientist at the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology, and he was recently promoted to Principal R&T Scientist. He was a postdoctoral fellow at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, from 2011 to 2013. Prior to that, he held a postdoctoral fellowship at Lancaster University from 2008 to 2011 on a NERC-funded programme and was a visiting scientist at Purdue University in 2010. He was awarded an International Mobility Fellowship by the Luxembourg National Research Fund from 2020 to 2023 to study ecosystem water cycle partitioning at the University of California, Berkeley.  His research interests include investigating the interactions of water, energy, and carbon fluxes in the terrestrial ecosystems by integrating thermal and multispectral remote sensing information in both physically based models and statistical models. He has co-authored around 50 publications in peer reviewed journals and has received over 5 million Euros in research funding from various organizations. His models and methods are used operationally for global evaporation mapping at NASA, JPL. He is the science PI of European ECOSTRESS Hub funded by European Space Agency (ESA) for generating continental scale evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), and water stress products. His model is also integrated in operational evaporation product development chain for the upcoming Indo-French TRISHNA mission. In collaborating with colleagues at CESBIO-France and INRAE-France, he is supporting the preparation of operational ET algorithm of the TRISHNA mission that will be launched in 2027.',
        Abstract:'Terrestrial ecosystems cover approximately 148 million km², which is 29% of the Earth’s surface. Their functioning is continuously altered due to the effects of global warming. It is critical to understand both the interaction and responses of vegetation to environmental changes and how these interactions influence the fluxes of water, energy, and carbon from ecosystems to the atmosphere. Central to these understandings are two significant ecosystem processes: evaporation and photosynthetic productivity (gross primary productivity). Existing approaches for modeling these processes are largely dominated by semi-empirical equations, many of which are over 50 years old. These models rely on a host of parameters and exhibit significant uncertainty in understanding ecosystem responses to water stress. Additionally, the global measurements through the eddy covariance network are inadequate to cover the vast land areas of the globe. Therefore, there is an ongoing emphasis on advancing our understanding of these processes from first principles and developing operational readiness for observing these processes from space data. At the Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST), we have been working on a new principle of analytical modeling that integrates thermal remote sensing data into surface energy balance theory and vegetation optical data into photosynthetic light use efficiency theory. This approach is able to retrieve evaporation and GPP without the need for complex parameterization and empirical calibration. The genuine advantage of this approach lies in its simplicity, efficiency, operational potential from remote sensing mission data, and the additional information it provides on the biophysical attributes of ecosystems across different aridity settings. In this talk, I will present this family of approaches, demonstrate how the results appear, compare them with other methods, and discuss their global implementation. This will provide an opportunity to share our latest results on remote sensing of evaporation, GPP, and the impacts of water stress on these processes.',

        Abstract:'Land surface hydrology is a collection of complex processes. The spatial variability both the land surface properties (soil and vegetation) as well as the meteorological inputs (precipitation and radiation) play an important role in hydrology. Satellite remote sensing has a broad spatial and repeat temporal view of the land surface and can provide observations for use in hydrology such as soil moisture, surface temperature, and vegetation density. The variability of the water cycle causes extremes such as droughts and floods and these have an impact on society. In addition, landslides and permafrost thaw are the two other hydrological extremes that impact society. In the past two decades with the advent of improved satellite sensors, modeling, and in-situ observations, quantification of the water cycle and its extremes has become possible. These satellite sensors include – microwave observations for soil moisture and precipitation; visible/near-infrared for vegetation and evapotranspiration, gravity for groundwater/total water, and thermal observations for surface temperature. In this talk, I will focus on using models, satellites, and in-situ observations for hydrological variability specifically as they relate to hydrological extremes.',

        Abstract:'Robert E. Horton (1875-1945) is regarded as the father of modern Hydrology for setting the field on a strong quantitative footing. While he published well over 200 works (papers, reports, and books), only about 80 of them have been listed in bibliographies until recently. His works are found scattered in several libraries and archives throughout the US. Our bibliography curation project, which began in 2018 nearly tripled the known list of Horton’s publications from 80 to over 200. We are digitizing all of these works, as well as his unpublished works, letters and drafts, to make them openly available to hydrologists. A GenAI-enabled Horton bot will be created to seamlessly access all the material so that hydrologists can “consult” with Horton on some of his fundamental contributions to hydrology. Noteworthy findings from our work includes Horton’s correspondence with Theodore von Karman circa 1938, for a work that is part of a “bluebook” (similar to Peter Eagleson’s 1991 report) where Horton lays out a comprehensive approach for runoff processes; a 1949 Hydrology textbook where Horton is not credited as co-author even though he spent 5 years of his time developing the book; a Hydrology handbook published posthumously in 1949, presumably the first of its kind, which may have inspired the classic Handbook of Hydrology by Ven te Chow (1962).',

        DateTime:'08 April 2024 (Monday), 04:00 pm',
        Platform:'MS Teams',
        AboutSpeaker:'Ashish is a Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia. He is an engineering hydrologist interested in problems involving hydrological uncertainty. Much of his research has focused on the impact of climate change and variability on hydrological practice, along with applications related to remote sensing, formulating stochastic approaches, developing hydrological models, and the two big hydrology bread-and-butter problems- design flood estimation + water resources management. Ashish has served as the President of the IAHS Commission on Statistical Hydrology and continued to serve as the Editor-in-Chief of the Journal of Hydrology-X, newly transformed to offer “Letter” contributions of broad international and methodological interest.',
        Abstract:'Can CMIP6 decadal projections be effective for multi-decadal water resources planning? This is the underlying question that motivates the present research, investigating what are the key deficiencies that limit their direct use for applications, and whether cleverly formulated mathematical alternatives can be used as effective postprocessors. This study focuses on the development of a robust framework for predicting droughts over interannual to decadal scales to enhance water resource management. The proposed framework adopts the Wavelet System Prediction (WASP) methodology, which transforms the spectral attributes inherent to climate indices to improve the skill of drought forecasts. Further improvement in forecasting capability is achieved through a Hierarchical Linear Combination (HLC) logic, which incorporates forecasts from ten climate indices that are obtained from CMIP6 decadal projections. These indices, including ENSO-related sea surface temperature anomalies and other climate drivers closely linked to Australian rainfall, are derived from decadal predictions of the Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP). The results of projected drought indices across various scales in Australia demonstrate the substantial potential of the integrated HLC-WASP framework to significantly improve the forecast skills of medium to long-term drought scenarios. It must be noted that the underpinning reason for the improvement here is not an enhancement of the dynamical forecasts, but a spectral modulation of their future simulations to define a new set of climate indices that are “optimal” for use in a forecasting context. In other words, wherever empirical forecasts are needed, the spectral transformation used here will redefine system predictors to maximize forecast quality to the extent that is mathematically possible.',

        Abstract:'Soil-water pollution from hydrocarbons and heavy metals, caused by both human activities and natural sources, is a growing concern. Efficient remediation techniques and monitoring systems are required to address this issue. In-situ remediation techniques offer a more sustainable and economical solution by treating a mixture of contaminants directly in place. This talk discusses the principles and applications of in-situ bioremediation methods and Permeable Reactive Barriers (PRBs), along with advanced monitoring methods. Engineered bioremediation techniques were studied for land sites polluted with hydrocarbons, and an in-situ PRB system was used to treat groundwater polluted with arsenic, as demonstrated through practical experiments. A comparative assessment of various bioremediation techniques (such as Biostimulation, bioaugmentation, phytoremediation, and natural biodegradation) was conducted to evaluate their biodegradation rate, lag phase duration, and total degradation time for hydrocarbons. These treatment techniques were then applied in the field to improve the soil and water quality of problematic sites in India. Similarly, in-situ remediation of arsenic-contaminated groundwater was investigated using a well-integrated PRB system. The findings of this research can enhance the practical application of novel, well-integrated PRB systems along with these composites for arsenic remediation. The importance of bio-monitoring, along with conventional physico-chemical monitoring techniques, is discussed in last for the better management of polluted sites. Overall, implementing in-situ remediation with cutting-edge monitoring techniques is a viable strategy for controlling (sub)-surface water and soil contamination, providing long-term solutions that protect public health and the environment.',

        Abstract:'Now serving over 40 million people and irrigating roughly 5 million acres of land over seven western US states and Mexico, reliance on Colorado River water has never been greater, paradoxically at a time when its annual flow has been low and unreliable due to the ongoing two decades long ‘millennial drought’. As a result, two large reservoirs that can hold four times the annual average flow, are at their historical lows, stressing the water resources to crisis level. This will only be exacerbated by a future warming climate in which such droughts are projected to be frequent. Thus, leading the Colorado River to be designated, in 2022, America’s most endangered river. The management of water resources via complex decrees and agreements, the ‘law of the river’, is struggling to help the stakeholders manage the water resources efficiently during this severe and sustained drought. To enable sustainable water resources in the future, a systematic understanding and modeling of past, current, and future variability is crucial. For, the past is prologue. This understanding will provide an informed judgment for stakeholders and decision-makers to debate options and enable robust decisions. This talk will provide an overview of the current understanding of the once and future variability of flows along with emerging models for flow simulation and projections for water resources management.',

        Abstract:'Access to clean fresh water is vital for human survival and contamination of freshwater sources, including groundwater and surface water, can cause adverse health effects. Heavy metal contamination in drinking water is unsafe and can cause various human diseases. Similarly, toxins released from pathogens like bacteria and viruses are among the most commonly found contaminants in water, leading to prevalent waterborne diseases. There is a need for rapid, cost-effective detection of the toxins in water. Spectrometry techniques for the detection of heavy metals show good sensitivity and low limits of detection but are difficult to handle and have high operation costs. Polymerase chain reaction and enzyme immunoassay techniques are the gold standard for pathogen detection. However, these methods require several complicated processing steps and expensive instrumentation, which makes these methods unsuitable for use in point-of-use systems. This talk will highlight how electrochemical biosensors are a practical solution for monitoring water quality parameters. Industrial facilities and chemical plants are significant sources of fugitive volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, and there is a need for cost-effective methods of screening these emissions. This talk will also highlight the results from a low-cost and rapid sensing system comprising an electrochemically anodized TiO2 nanotube-based sensor array to detect benzene, toluene, and ethanol at room temperature.',

        Abstract:' Fire suppression activities in the past few decades in North America have led to higher fuel accumulations, which coupled with shifting hydroclimatic patterns has led to an increase in frequency and severity of wildland fires. Prescribed fires and fuel treatments such as mechanical thinning are deemed to be effective tools to manage fuel loads and establish a higher degree of control over landscape management and restoration against catastrophic megafires. However, assessing the effectiveness of fuel treatments is rendered complicated due to several factors such as wind, fuel moisture, and fire-atmospheric interactions at the fine scales. The present work explores these issues by using physics-based simulations and data analysis from novel experiments while varying the degrees of fuel treatments and fuel moisture, as observed during different stages of fuel management. Systematically varying these parameters yield widely different fire behavior patterns. Detailed analyses on turbulent heat and energy exchange are conducted to understand the fundamental processes governing varying regimes of fire intensity, fire spread, ember transport, and fuel consumption under different conditions of fuel moisture and treatment. The conclusions are generalized to highlight the importance of considering vegetation response to hydrometeorological events, coupled with fine-scale fire-atmosphere interactions while managing wildland fire behavior. On the other hand, wildland fires themselves are characterized by their own weather which is driven by both shear and buoyancy-driven turbulence. They also act as a local source for scalars, namely greenhouse gases (such as carbon dioxide and water) and soot particles as resultants of the ignition process. In this talk, we will explore the complex turbulent dynamics of wildfire propagation using the tools of micrometeorology. Insights into the energetics of turbulent exchange processes during fire propagation will lead to a better understanding and improved models for wildland fire behavior.',

        Abstract:' Significant uncertainty in sea level projections stems from poorly understood evolution processes of polar ice sheets. The recent IPCC report states that a more than 15 m global mean sea-level rise cannot be discarded under high emission scenarios by 2300, mainly owing to instability processes associated with the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. In this presentation, I review current knowledge of ice sheet dynamics, instability processes, and feedback mechanisms involving oceans, atmosphere, and solid Earth. While constraining individual processes is critical, I argue that a system modeling approach is essential for improved projections of the polar ice sheets and global and regional sea levels.',

        Abstract:'An iconic feature of the Indian Summer Monsoon Rainfall (ISMR), a longer than June-September rainy season over the Northeast India (NEI) while a much shorter one over the northwest India is expected to be altered by climate change but an objective definition of the length of the monsoon rainy season (LRS) over the NEI is lacking. While the May rainfall over the NEI is larger than June rainfall over central India (CI), the Onset of monsoon over NEI is considered to take place by June 5 by IMD. Here, defining the LRS objectively over NEI, we show that that climatological onset over NEI takes place around 18th May and withdrawal around 15th October making the length of the rainy season ~155 days. We further show that the El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a primary driver of LRS while rainfall during LRS is poorly correlated with the ENSO. We also provide compelling evidence to establish that May rainfall is ‘monsoon rainfall’ and not ‘pre-monsoon’ rainfall as assumed by the community so far. Inclusion of May rainfall over NEI in the seasonal rainfall of All India monsoon rainfall has important implications on variability and predictability of India monsoon rainfall. In contrast to a significant decreasing trend of LRS and LRS-rainfall during the historical period, the projected LRS under SSP5-8.5 scenario continues to decrease while the LRS-rainfall acquires a significant increasing trend over NEI. A significant increase in impact of hydrological disasters is expected over NEI in future due to increasing intensity and frequency of extreme rain-events within a shorter rainy-season.',

        Abstract:' There is a steady shift away from the analog model building and upward scaling analysis towards mathematical/digital representation of the physical processes – called digital twin, that captures most if not, all aspects of the process in question. While models represent our perceptions and are abstractions of reality, the actual observations of physical processes (modulo the measurement noise) represent reality. The mathematical process of bridging the gap between the model and the observation has come to be known as Data Assimilation. Using a simple example, this talk will bring out the benefits of data assimilation in improving the quality of forecast products. An overview of various methods for dynamic data assimilation will be provided.',

        Abstract:'The Millennium Drought in south-eastern Australia (1997-2009 ) was a 13-year extended dry period during which unusual catchment responses were observed. In just over half of the catchments investigated a statistically significant downward shift in long-term annual rainfall-runoff relationship was observed. In those shifted catchments, a given amount of rainfall resulted in less runoff than expected during the drought. Furthermore, later research demonstrated that many of the shifted catchments had not recovered several years after the drought ended and they were still producing less runoff than expected. Here I present a summary of recent results from our investigations into shifted rainfall-runoff relationships and modelling of runoff during the Millennium Drought. The Millennium Drought is an observed case study of a prolonged dry period, potentially indicative of future conditions in south-eastern Australia, which has significant implications for long-term streamflow behavior and modelling of climate change runoff projections.',

        Abstract:'Hydrologic modeling efforts have to contend with several types of uncertainties. Measurement uncertainties exist because of errors in measurements of state variables, while structural uncertainties result from errors in the mathematical representation of hydrologic processes. Further, parametric uncertainties arise from both measurement and structural uncertainties, and because of limited information in the available data. Despite its ubiquitous nature, uncertainty quantification is not addressed often because of (i) lack of good algorithms, and (ii) inability to separate the various forms of uncertainty through calibration exercises. In this regard, Dr. Govindaraju will share some of his enduring research efforts that he has been pursuing in collaboration with students, and try to read the tea leaves as to where his future efforts will lead him in this journey.',

        Abstract:'There is an increasing need to engage with broad audiences to convey the findings, importance of scientific research and motivate younger generations to be involved with science. Academic and research institutions, funding bodies and government agencies are very interested in scientists being able to engage widely with the public. When it comes to sharing about their research to a broad audience- be it educated people, lay audience or school children it is indeed a challenge for scientists to convey the hypothesis, methods, findings and conclusions without technical jargon or feeling like they are “diluting the science”. In this talk, we will discuss the state of science communication, principles and best practices for communication to a broad audience. Benefits of this kind of engagement to the scientist and society will also be presented. The presentation will also discuss how scientists can use science communication as a tool to further interdisciplinary research collaboration and non-traditional stakeholder collaborations.',

        Abstract:'Integrated water management and planning has been a focus of research for many decades, but only recently we have started discussing the challenge from a systems perspective. The need for systems approach to water management is defined through integration between physical, environmental, and socio-economic components of the system, for which the evidence should be provided at adequate spatiotemporal resolutions. In this seminar, the novel Water Systems Integration Modelling (WSIMOD) Framework will be presented. The WISMOD allows for the representation of the water system’s demands and impacts of multiple sectors and actors’ decisions within a single tool, which is considered beneficial to increasing a shared understanding of system performance and for more collaborative and coherent decisions on integrated water resources, water quality and flood management. The WSIMOD is a self-contained software package that includes modelled representations of key physical and infrastructure elements of the water cycle (urban and rural), with each type of modelled element generically described as a component. Components are written in such a way that any component can interact with any other component. This enables a flexible representation of a water system that is needed to accommodate the wide variety of different built/natural infrastructure configurations and scales. The talk will showcase how the tool has been developed and successfully tested through a range of applications in the UK, including integrated analysis of urban water systems, catchment water management and urban water neutrality.',

        Abstract:'This study provides a formal analysis of the design of an Indian food procurement system that considers climate-driven variations in renewable water supply, needs for groundwater pumping, varying regional productivity of crops, and farm-level economics, assuming that the food security goals are to be met while keeping current procurement prices fixed for each crop and maximizing net aggregate farm income from the procurement system. A systems approach is taken to integrate data from disparate sources and predict water stress and sustainable agricultural enhancement regions. A by-product of the analysis is a reduction in the aggregate use of non-renewable water and the consequent decrease in irrigation water requirements and hence water and energy stress. Thus, the “climate-food-water-energy-livelihood” nexus of issues is addressed conjunctively by leveraging data analytics and systems approaches. The talk will be based on our recent paper in Nature Communications on solving groundwater depletion in India while achieving food security https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-31122-9',

        Abstract:'Rapid urbanization and intensification of extreme climatic events directly affect peak flow and water quality in streams in both urban and mixed-use watersheds. Low Impact Development (LID) strategies such as Green Roof (GR) and Rain Garden (RG) can partially mitigate such effects on stormwater runoff and water quality. However, efficiency of LID strategies in handling moderate to large rainfall events to improve the water quality of a watershed is not well understood. Thus, this talk will discuss how different LID strategies affect peak flow and water quality in urban and mixed-use watersheds. The analysis on effects of different LID strategies showed that during the high rainfall intensity event of 15 cm/day, no significant differences due to LID strategies were observed on the peak flow reduction. However, about 32% reduction in peak flow was attained when all three LID strategies considered in this study (GR, RG and GR+RG in series) under low to moderate rainfall intensities of 2 – 3 cm/day. In addition, better water management strategies are needed to mitigate floods and droughts by co-managing green (wetlands) and grey (dams) infrastructure. A framework to co-manage green and grey infrastructure will be discussed to enhance water resilience under extreme climatic events.',

        Abstract:'ISRO is operating a fleet of Earth Observation satellites with a wide range of sensors of varying capabilities. In addition to making satellites and launch vehicles, ISRO is also conducting scientific research and demonstrating applications of space-based inputs in many disciplines including agriculture, forestry, geology, environmental studies, urban planning, infrastructure development, meteorology, planetary sciences, disaster management, etc. The efficient utilization of this voluminous geospatial content generated by the thematic experts and the data acquired by several Indian and publicly available EO satellites is essential for adding greater societal value as envisaged by Dr Vikram Sarabhai, the founder of India’s space programme. In this context, the Space Applications Centre at Ahmedabad contemplated the development of the ‘Visualization of EO Data and Archival System’, abbreviated as VEDAS. It aims to organize the vast quantum of geospatial databases on various themes and develop customized decision support systems and applications for an improved understanding of the earth and planetary systems. VEDAS is a step towards creating a “geo-data-rich society” supporting mainstreaming of satellite imagery and remote sensing in the process of National Development. In this talk, I will provide an overview of the VEDAS, its capabilities and its potential for research and decision-making, while illuminating what lies ahead for us.

        Abstract:'‘How to become a professor in an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)?’ is a question which is asked by several in our country. There is an increasingly large number of awareness and mentoring programs conducted by organizations and academies in this country to address this query among the public in general, and graduate students in particular. Another equally important question to which answers must be sought is, ‘How to survive as an early career academic or researcher in today’s India?’. Many Indian academic or research institutions offer to young professionals what are termed as ‘permanent’ jobs; however, stagnation, dearth of progress and lack of navigation along multiple directions of growth (both one’s own individual growth and that of his/her employer) can prove fatal for one’s career and more importantly, personal well-being, if adequate, timely steps are not taken to make sure one is not only ‘surviving’ but also ‘thriving’, particularly compared to global benchmarks. In this seminar, I will talk about key responsibilities expected out of an early career academic in a leading engineering institute in India, highlight some opportunities and challenges towards a bright and successful academic/research career and also offer suggestions to avoid some mistakes (I think) I did. I will share some stories, and advice that I had been lucky to receive, and hopefully hear back from the audience about what drives them towards their own pursuit of excellence. Women graduate students and early career researchers are expected to particularly benefit from this talk, since I will also share some experiences and suggestions on overcoming gender-defined obstructions.',

        AboutSpeaker:'Alexandre Anesio is a Professor in Arctic Microbiology in the Department of Environmental Science at Aarhus University. His main research interest is on microbial and biogeochemical processes in glaciers and ice sheets. He is currently one of the PIs in a European Research Council Synergy grant to investigate how pigmented algae, growing directly on the snow and bare ice, through their photophysiology, have a crucial role in changing the reflectivity of the ice (i.e., albedo), and subsequently the melt rates of the ice. Anesio obtained his PhD degree at Lund University in Sweden in 2000, where he also worked as postdoc until 2003. Since then, he has worked at the University of Nottingham (2003-2004), Aberystwyth University (2004-2007) and University of Bristol (2007-2018), until moving to Denmark in 2018.',
        Abstract:'Glaciers and ice sheets were long believed to be sterile environments, but just like other large ecosystems (e.g., tropical forests, tundra), they are now widely recognized as one of the Earth’s biomes, teeming with life. This biome is also the most under-investigated on the planet from a biological and biogeochemical perspective, representing a new and exciting frontier in science. Home to large, naturally occurring communities of mostly microbes, glaciers and ice sheets host metabolically active organisms, interacting with each other. These processes represent more than just a minor curiosity of life under extreme conditions. On glacier and ice sheet surfaces, microbes have been shown to alter physical and chemical characteristics of snow and ice with direct consequences for snow/ice solar-heating and amplified melt. During the summer ablation, the bare ice is largely dark, as it is colonized by pigmented ice algae. Biological growth of icebound algal cells can accumulate biomass high enough to cause albedo reduction between 12% and 21%, depending on the algal cell abundances. The impact of microbially-mediated albedo effect is predicted to increase further with climate change, since a warming climate will further extend melt seasons. Furthermore, microbial activity and carbon fixation on ice surfaces can result in export of labile dissolved organic matter to downstream ecosystems.',

        Abstract:'Urbanization is a global phenomenon and a notable feature of anthropogenic impacts. Cities have a relatively small spatial footprint, but likely have a much larger and discernable impact on the regional weather, and hydroclimatic processes.

        Abstract:'The mega-Himalayan river Ganges (or Ganga), one of the largest in the world and the lifeline of northern India for the last several thousand years, hosting almost 10% of the present global and half of Indian population on its fertile banks, has been found to have unprecedented low levels of river water (drying up) in several lower reaches in the summers of recent years. Using a combination of satellite-based and in-situ measurements of river water and groundwater levels, isotopic and chemical analyses of Ganges river and groundwater, simulation results from global hydrologic models and regional groundwater flow models, shows that the present-day summer drying of the river Ganges is possibly driven by groundwater depletion in the Gangetic aquifers of north India. One hypothesis is that a decrease in groundwater inflow (baseflow) has a severe impact on the health of the river. The present-day baseflow to the Ganges from the adjoining aquifers, which may be up to a third of total river volume during pre-monsoon months, might have decreased by >50% from the beginning of irrigation-pumping age in the 1970s. Under several assumptions and approximations, it has been predicted that the groundwater contribution to Ganges river water flow would continue to decrease in impending years, and can decrease up to ~75% of the 1970s. Thus, a continuation of the groundwater exploitation at similar per-capita rates might jeopardize the existence of the Ganges River in several reaches in near future, thereby leading to disastrous carbohydrate and other food scarcity for ~ 115 million people inhabiting in the study region by 2050.',

Aditi is a human geographer by training and has a PhD from Cambridge University, United Kingdom.',
        Abstract:'IPCC Working Group II formally launched its report on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability on 28th of February, 2022. The writing of this report involved over 270 scientists who spent last 3 years going through literature and assessing the impact of climate change on human and natural systems, and role of adaptation in alleviating some of these impacts. Water chapter is one among 18 chapters in this report. This chapter reiterates findings from WGI report about intensification of water cycle, and shows how every sector of the economy (agriculture, energy, urban etc.) and ecosystems have been affected by this climate induced intensification of water cycle. Majority of world’s population, especially those involved in climate sensitive occupations like agriculture are feeling impacts of climate change through changes in the water cycle, such as through extreme precipitation, melting of glaciers, floods and droughts. The chapter also finds that water is also a part of solution. A large majority of the adaptation options are in response to water related hazards, or adaptation response itself is water related, e.g., irrigation, soil moisture conservation, water storage, rainwater harvesting etc. Many of these water adaptation responses have several benefits, including instances of climate risk reduction. However, effectiveness of these adaptation measures in reducing climate risks goes down substantially at higher levels of global warming, thereby emphasizing the importance of mitigation along with adaptation.',

        AboutSpeaker:'Paul Bates FRS is Professor of Hydrology at the University of Bristol, UK and Chairman of Fathom (www.fathom.global). He is one of the world’s leading experts in the modelling of flood inundation with widespread research interests in risk, resilience, uncertainty, governance and decision making in relation to natural hazards and global water issues. His main area of study is to develop new numerical solutions to the Shallow Water equations and combines these with satellite and airborne data to advance our fundamental understanding of flood dynamics and reduce threats to life and economic losses worldwide. Previously, he was Director of the Cabot Institute and Head of the School of Geographical Sciences at Bristol and has spent sabbatical periods at Laboratoire National d’Hydraulique et Environnment in Paris, the EU Joint Research Centre, Princeton University and the NASA Jet Propulsion Lab at CALTECH. He has published over 240 papers in International peer reviewed journals and has an ISI H-Index of 80 and a Google Scholar H-Index of 100. He is a lifetime Fellow of the Royal Society of London and the American Geophysical Union, a Royal Society Wolfson Research Award holder and in 2019 was awarded a CBE by Queen Elizabeth II for services to flood risk management. Through his work with insurers, charities and NGOs the data sets created using methods developed by his team are used to reduce risks to life and economic losses for hundreds of millions of people globally. ',
        Abstract:'Flooding is one of the most costly natural disasters and every year affects tens of millions of people and causes billions of dollars in losses, and the most damaging events have affect very large areas. Despite this, the reality is that all flood impacts are felt locally and occur at the level of individual properties. The ultimate challenge in flood modelling therefore is how to provide detailed and skilful hazard and risk predictions at the scale of individual buildings over whole continents or even the whole globe. This talk describes recent efforts at the University of Bristol in the UK to build a two dimensional hydrodynamic model at 90m resolution covering the entire planet and 30m over the parts of the US, Europe and the UK, both for current conditions and future climates. The talk describes the technical challenges and also detailed validation studies which demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of this type of model.',

        Platform:'MS Teams',
        AboutSpeaker:' Prof. S.K. Tandon is an eminent geoscientist and academician who has been associated with several institutions of higher learning of our country. After an early stint at the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology from 1971 to 1976, he taught at the University of Delhi for 34 years until his retirement from there in 2010. Later, he was involved in teaching/research and mentoring at the Earth and Environmental Sciences departments of the   IIT Kanpur (2013-2015), IISER Bhopal (2016-2022) and IISER Mohali (2017). Prof. Tandon has broad research interests in the field of geodynamic evolution of India and has contributed significantly to the understanding of several Phanerozoic stratigraphic records of the country, including the Late Quaternary sequences of the Ganga Plains and the Thar desert of Rajasthan. His lasting interest is in the understanding of Earth Surface Processes- both in modern and ancient continental sedimentary systems; it is this interest in Earth Surface Processes that has attracted him to the subject of Anthropocene. Prof. Tandon has authored over 150 research papers and has co-edited both books and journal special issues/volumes. He is a Fellow of all the three science academies in India, besides being a Fellow of the Third World Academy of Sciences. He has served the Research Councils and the Governing Bodies of most of the Earth Sciences institutes of the country, and has chaired several of the Earth Science Committees of the DST, SERB, CSIR, besides having been the Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University of Delhi from 2005 to 2010.',
        Abstract:'The term Anthropocene, little known two decades ago, was introduced by Crutzen and Stoermer in 2000 and is now in common usage in the discourse of different science disciplines, particularly in the Earth, Environmental and Life Sciences. Further, it has also been adopted in art and cinema, humanities, social sciences, and policy and governance amongst others. The essence of the concept is well articulated in the title of an article published in 2008 by three leading authorities (Steffen, Crutzen, and McNeill): ‘The Anthropocene: Are humans now overwhelming the great forces of nature?’ Notwithstanding debates around the meaning and definition of the term, as well as the placement of the lower boundary of the Anthropocene, the informal usage of the term stands firmly entrenched across several domains of knowledge. Additionally, the concept of a human-dominated planet is closely linked to the ideas of tipping points, planetary boundaries, and the exploration of safe operating space(s) for humanity, that have been quite effectively championed in the last decade by Rockstrom and his collaborators. Of the nine planetary boundaries advanced by these authors in an influential article published in Ecology and Society in 2009, the water boundary along with the attendant water cycle modifications /water resilience are issues of strong concern, and are therefore being elaborated currently. In this talk, I shall discuss the development of these concepts in addition to presenting a few examples from India’s disturbed river systems.',

        Abstract:' While the Global North and South were very different in terms of their trajectory of economic growth some years ago, now they are increasingly convergent on economic growth as well as their environmental sustainability. It is now also well known that cities are the engines of economic growth in developing countries of the Global South. However, much as they are the engines of the economy, cities are also blamed for carbon emissions due to a number of factors. But cities are also victims of carbon emissions and climate change due to the density of population and economic activity. Carbon emissions are determined not only by urbanization, but also by a city’s spatial area, its income, energy consumption, and value added by industry. In this research we understand the role played by various factors on carbon emissions empirically by examining India’s data at the district level, where city level data on carbon emissions are quite rare. We use a unique dataset of carbon footprint at the district level, adapting from Lee et al (2021). We estimate carbon emissions as dependent on the district area, urbanization, per capita income, literacy rate, workforce participation and population density. We find rising literacy rate, urbanization, labor force participation, poverty ratio and income to be major causes of rising carbon footprint. We find geographic area of a district has no effect on carbon footprint. Given that reducing poverty ratio is a factor in increasing carbon footprint, the question to ask is if this is equitable. The regression is used to predict carbon emissions in the medium term, i.e., 2030, and longer run, i.e., 2050, assuming current trends continue.',

        Abstract:'Using freshwater for toilet flushing is a luxury humans cannot afford anymore. With increasing population, climate change and expanding pressures on water resources, much of the world faces a major water crisis. Globally, water shortages are estimated to affect more than 4 billion people annually.  India occupies only 2.4 % of the world’s total land area yet supports over 17.5 % of the global population. The total freshwater resource of the country is only 4% of the world’s total utilizable water resource, which is disproportionately low for the current population. In India, over 600 million people face high to extreme water scarcity, with water contamination estimated to impact as much as 70 % of the country’s utilizable water resource. Rural areas face the twin challenges of water scarcity and risk of groundwater contamination due to lack of water treatment options. In this presentation, I will discuss about the design and field implantation of decentralized wastewater treatment system for a rural community. The challenges and opportunities at operating such stand-alone system will be discussed. Also, in this task I will present how cities can become a perennial source of treated water for neighbouring villages. The challenges, opportunities and threats of a large scale (440 MLD) treated water recycling scheme will be discussed.',

        Abstract:'Water availability mediates rural and urban development through its impacts on a range of sectors such as agriculture and industry. Climate change and associated risks attenuate this water availability. Given this, various adaptation options have been implemented in the water sector. These are interventions targeting demand management or supply augmentation; focussing on improving water use efficiency etc. However, which adaptation options are feasible in particular contexts and how should one prioritise interventions? To answer this question (and inform adaptation prioritisation), it is critical to assess the various adaptation options in the water sector and synthesise lessons on which options are feasible and under what conditions. This talk will outline how the multidimensional feasibility of adaptation options in the water sector can be assessed. It will then showcase how adaptation feasibility is regionally differentiated, two case studies are discussed: flood management in cities; and community-based watershed management in rural areas. The approach also links climate adaptation aims with other concurrent issues facing water managers – that of synergies and trade-offs with climate mitigation and sustainable development. Water has been called the “middle child of global climate policy” (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-021-01154-y), this talk will outline one way to think of addressing this and highlight how the water sector already has a suite of adaptation choices to draw on.',

As an Earth System Scientist, Raghu studies the interactions between the physical world and life and explore the co evolution of life and climate and what it means for sustainability. Data analysis, Regional Earth System Modeling and Predictions are combined to advance process and predictive understanding of the Earth System, especially at regional scales. His hypothesis is that all global warming is local and the impacts are manifest in the food, water, energy and health nexus. Producing region specific predictive information at daily to seasonal timescale that is useful and usable and what if scenarios for years to decades are his main interests. His personal interest also includes agroforestry as a sustainable agriculture and watershed management approach and its ability to sequester additional carbon in soils while enhancing drought resilience and soil moisture persistence',
        Abstract:'India has made tremendous progress in the process and predictive understandings of monsoon variability, change and extremes. The extensive investments in predictions systems have paid off with increasing skills at short, medium, and extended ranges as well as at seasonal to interannual timescales and future a projections of monsoons. Applications of the forecasts, especially at the sub seasonal to seasonal (S 2 S) forecasts are growing. Unfortunately, the warm temperatures and the monsoons also favour explosion of pathogens and their ingestion by humans India remains a hotspot for diseases. Time is ripe for early warning systems for waterborne diseases at the S 2 S timescale to build a Ready Set Go system to manage health outcomes and reduce disease morbidity, mortality and productivity losses. The high spatial variability of the monsoon rains and extremes and their relation to external drivers such as El Niño are explored in the context of Enteric Fever cases in Surat and Ahmedabad. Some ways forward on mapping and synthesising water quality and health data across India and building health early warning systems are discussed.',

        Abstract:'The water quality of freshwater and coastal systems is constantly changing due to varying anthropological and climatological inputs.  However, our ability to manage and predict water quality is often limited by sparse monitoring data and an incomplete understanding of the relevant biogeochemical processes.  This presentation will highlight recent research synthesizing long-term datasets, process-based models, and statistical (i.e., Bayesian) inference to enhance our understanding of water-quality dynamics.  These data-driven models systematically update prior knowledge of key biophysical rates while providing rigorous uncertainty quantification.  Case studies include algal blooms in Lake Erie, hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and nutrient dynamics in southeastern U.S. watersheds and reservoirs.  Model applications for seasonal and scenario-based water-quality forecasting will also be shown.  In particular, the sensitivity of water-quality outcomes to changes in watershed development, nutrient loading, and climate is explored.  Finally, challenges and research opportunities for advancing these data-driven, water-quality modeling approaches are highlighted.',

        Abstract:'Terrestrial waters, despite being less than 1 % of the total amount of water on Earth’s ice-free land are essential for life and human environment. They play a primary role in the global water and carbon cycles, with significant impacts on climate variability. A better characterization of their  distribution and dynamic over the whole globe is therefore of highest priority, including for the management of water resources. However, despite their importance, basic questions are still opened such as: what are the spatio-temporal variations of the fluxes and storages of continental freshwater across scales and how do they interact with climate and the anthropogenic pressure? Those questions are specifically important for the Tropics which are now facing growing demands for freshwater availability. Firstly, using multi-satellite observation techniques, we will quantify the global variations of monthly surface water extent (at 25km spatial resolution) over ~25 years (1992-2015) and assess their recent changes both in terms of climate variability and anthropogenic pressure. For large river such as the Amazon, the Ganges-Brahmaputra (G-B) or the Congo, we further combined our surface water extent estimates with hundreds of radar altimeter-derived water level time-series and DEM data to derive the spatio-temporal variability of surface freshwater storage (SWS). Over the Amazon for instance, we show that the annual amplitude of SWS variations is of ~1200km3 and contributes to ~50% of the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE)-derived total water storage variations (TWS). During the 2005 exceptional drought, we estimate that the SWS deficit over the entire Amazon basin in October was about 70% as compared to other years. While over G-B we found similar contributions  of mean annual variation in SWS to TWS as for the Amazon, over the Congo this contribution is smaller, around 20%. Over the Amazon, the SSW variations are then used to decompose the GRACE-derived TWS and to isolate the variations groundwater storage and show that it contribute to ~30% of GRACE-derived (TWS). Additionally, using radar altimetry observations, we quantify for these large rivers their long term discharge, providing an unprecedented sources of information on the dynamic of the fresh water fluxes to the ocean. We will illustrate the impacts of G-B and Irrawaddy rivers on the Bay of Bengal ocean dynamic. Finally, we will discuss the future of hydrology from space with the launch in 2022 of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT, NASA-CNES) satellite, which in synergy with the current deployment of the COPERNICUS Sentinel program, will offer an unprecedented view of continental freshwater dynamics on Earth.

        Abstract:'Seen to be at the vanguard of the STEM to STEAM movement, the Science Gallery network is the world’s first university-linked network dedicated to public engagement with science and art with galleries in Atlanta, Dublin, London, Melbourne, Rotterdam, Venice, and Detroit. Science Gallery Bengaluru is the first such gallery of the network in Asia with the mandate to deliver a global mission drawing on the intellectual capital of three of India’s leading research institutions, Indian Institute of Science, National Centre for Biological Science and Srishti Institute of Art, Design and Technology. In this talk, I will introduce the form and structure of the new institution, and explore with us the ideas that inform the shape of Science Gallery Bengaluru through her journey to answer to one question: what does it mean to go beyond science communication towards an engagement with science? Science Gallery Bengaluru is working with an idea we call “living exhibitions” that expand conversations around research through atypical juxtapositions to draw in the public at large. SUBMERGE was our first foray into this format, where we actively brought together exhibits and connected programming around the theme of water and its intersection with human life. https://bengaluru.sciencegallery.com/submerge-programmes',

        AboutSpeaker:'Dr. Atul Kumar Sahai has obtained his Masters and Ph D degree in Mathematics from the University of Allahabad. He is Scientist G and the Project Director of Monsoon Mission at Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune, and is leading the group of Extended Range Prediction. Dr. Sahai has expertise in climate variability and prediction, climate modeling, tropical convection, monsoon dynamics, extreme weather, MJO, role of remote teleconnections from ENSO and IOD, climate change and regional climate scenario generation for impact assessment studies based on regional climate models, operational climate services, flood/drought, cyclones and extreme precipitation prediction, heat and cold wave prediction, high-performance computing, and utilization of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the field of climate science. His most notable research led to the development of a dynamical ensemble prediction system for predicting the intra-seasonal oscillations of the Indian summer monsoon season. Due to the remarkable skill of this system, it has been awarded the ISO 9001:2008 standard certification in the year 2016 and it has been operationalised in India Meteorological Department. Since then, it is being used for real time forecasting of the onset, active/break spells and withdrawal phases of the Indian summer monsoon, heavy rainfall events, cold waves, heatwaves, Monsoon Intraseasonal Oscillations, Madden-Julian Oscillation, cyclogenesis, and fluctuations in summer/winter monsoon. Dr. Sahai has also formulated several strategies for the application of these extended range forecasts in agriculture, hydrology, health, and disaster management. He was given additional charge as Head, Climate Research and Services, India Meteorological Department (IMD) Pune for two years (2017 2018). During this tenure, he integrated and lead IMD Pune operations as per the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS) formulated by World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and established Regional Climate Centre. Dr Sahai is also a Member of Scientific Steering Committee of World Weather Research Programme (2019-2022) of WMO.',
        Abstract:'Dynamical extended range prediction provides an outlook of meteorological parameters up to 2-3 weeks in advance. The extended range prediction group at IITM has developed an ensemble prediction system based on the Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) model adopted from NCEP, USA. This prediction system proves to be very useful in predicting the intraseasonal fluctuations such as onset, active/break spells and withdrawal within the Indian summer monsoon and also the extreme weather events such as heat/cold waves, cyclones and heavy rainfall events. This system is also skilful in predicting the extremes in monthly rainfall. The India Meteorological Department is generating weekly agricultural, hydrological and health bulletins based on these extended range outlooks. Such predictions in rainfall and other surface meteorological variables can also be used as an input to hydrological models to predict impending floods and inundations along river basins. Long lead-time predictions provide sufficient time for the decision-making process for the stakeholders. River basin rainfall forecast over the Indian region during the monsoon season in the extended range thus has several useful applications in the hydrometeorological forecast domain. In this talk it will be discussed that how the extended-range forecast is generated and how it can be used for efficient hydrological modelling to improve the flood forecast, dam management etc.',

She obtained her Ph.D from IISc, civil engineering department in 2008. In Dr. Anandhi’s group, during research, teaching, and outreach, they often use this concept: “There are known knowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns”. This aids in the application of computational intelligence for modeling ecosystem processes and their interactions at the food-water-energy (FEW) nexus while improving these predictions to environmental changes (climate, water-use and land-use) using complex systems engineering. They continue to develop novel solutions to engineering design and decision methodology for synergizing FEW systems for efficient, productive, and sustainable ecosystem management. For this they use a mixture of systems thinking approaches, conceptual and structural models, artificial intelligence, spatial statistics, and machine learning for analysis of the ecosystem services by exploiting new data streams to advance the system adaptation, resilience, and stress mitigation. Dr. Anandhi has authored 55+ research and teaching articles and obtained ~$12 Million funding.

        Abstract:'This talk presents a review and analysis of the current state of research and practice in the Food- Energy-Water (FEW) nexus. It is intended to provide scientists and practitioners in the FEW domains the tools, data, knowledge, and successful applications in this research and practice area. The talk also describes knowledge gaps in the FEW nexus domains. The objectives of this talk are (a) to synthesize existing knowledge in defining and conceptualizing FEW nexus for the stakeholders and help guide them in defining and conceptualizing their own FEW nexus, (b) to identify limitations and knowledge gaps. The following questions assisted in addressing the objectives: Which systems are involved? Where is the nexus applied or intended to be applied and at what scale? How are the nexus elements assessed? and Who should be considered? The study provides narrow and broad definitions as well as simple and complex conceptualization frameworks of FEW nexus that stakeholders can use while being aware of the limitations and knowledge gaps.',

        Abstract:'Accurate measurements of precipitation that characterize its spatial and temporal variability in a region are quintessential for the success of hydrologic modeling and design. Point measurements (i.e., rain gage observations) often plagued with systematic and random errors while lacking spatial coverage are questionable inputs to hydrologic design procedures and inadequate for distributed hydrologic modeling applications. Multi-sensor source-based quantitative precipitation estimates (QPEs) developed as gridded datasets/products are increasingly being used by hydrological modeling and design communities. This talk will focus on QPEs developed using weather-surveillance radar (WSR) using rain gage information as ground truth and will address issues related to the generation of radar-based precipitation estimates, Improvements in QPEs, bias analysis, and correction methods. The utility and validity of these QPEs for hydrologic modeling, design, and hydrosystems disaster management will be discussed.',

        Abstract:'All over the world, water resources systems face unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, degradation, and changing climatic boundary conditions. This poses a major challenge to their sustainable management, which is often aggravated by a scarcity of scientific evidence to support decision making. Despite the advent of remotely sensed data sources such as satellite imagery, quantifying the nature and scale of hydrological processes still relies strongly on in situ observations, which are often time and labour intensive. For example, many of the worlds rivers and other water bodies are still poorly gauged, while hydrometric monitoring networks are in decline in many places. This makes it opportune to explore new arrangements to support and improve hydrological data collection and evidence generation. One such arrangement is citizen science, which refers to the participation of the general public in the scientific discovery process. Although citizen science in itself is not a new phenomenon, the advent of new technologies for hydrological sensing, data processing, and communication opens new perspectives for its application in a water resources context. Moreover, citizen science may provide an opportunity to make the evidence creation process more collaborative, transparent and inclusive. However, implementing sustainable citizen science projects faces many challenges, ranging from the deployment of adequate and robust technologies, to ensuring the generation of long lasting benefits for all the involved actors. Here I draw upon experiences from South America, Africa, and South Asia to discuss some of the challenges and potential solutions of implementing citizen science and other types of participatory monitoring in a water resources context. I synthesise these findings by outlining an analytic framework that may help in the design and implementation of citizen science for natural resources management.',

        Abstract:'Water is closely linked with human existence and survival. Relationship between humans and water is unique. Most ancient civilizations, including the Harappan (Indus Valley) civilization, developed and grew in the vicinity of springs, lakes, rivers and oceans. In the struggle for development, the need to carefully manage water propelled the growth of hydrologic science in ancient India. However, most of the knowledge of hydrologic sciences developed by our forefathers remained hidden and unknown to the world at large until the recent times.  Based on ancient literature and evidences revealed by the recent explorations, this talk will provide some fascinating glimpses into the hydrological, hydraulic and related knowledge that was developed in ancient India. The talk will also cover the water management activities in different times and describe how the management decisions evolved in different periods in response to the type and magnitude of demands for water, preferences/choices of the society, and available technology at those times.',

        Abstract:'Science influences society through its knowledge and world view. Scientific knowledge influence the way many individuals in society think about themselves, others, and the environment. Societal challenges often inspire questions for scientific research, and social priorities often influence research priorities through the availability of funding for research. Water is emerging the most essential focus to the future development and economic growth of any region / society. There has been a steady increase in the demand for water use from different sectors such as domestic users – urban and rural, economic sectors – agriculture & allied sectors, services and industry apart from environmental flow requirements. This needs a paradigm shift in planning investments and management of water resources. For effective and sustainable water resources management, several policies have been made in the past – both nationally and at state level, and some are being made and various departments or agencies in the government are assigned with the responsibility of implementing these policies. Some laws are also enacted to implement the policy. The whole gamut of these actions is the governance of water resources. Government of Karnataka committed to create an enabling environment towards achieving water and food security adopting the IWRM principles and approach and had setup a new entity ACIWRM which acts as a think tank to the state Water Resources Department, engaging in policy analysis, research, planning, capacity building and develop the knowledge base to gear up the department to its future vision. How was the water science knowledge harvested for evolving new water policy and what partnerships between government and scientific institutions are playing the major role in bringing in a paradigm shift in perspectives of water resources management.',

        Abstract:'Technological solutions are transforming water resources management at an unprecedented pace. Management and governance of water resources are being influenced by a simple utilization of low cost intervention – such as a sensors — to the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analytics. Such influences are, inter alia, helping to make reliable estimation of freshwater supplies, fostering access to high quality water, improving irrigation efficiencies for food production, and making industrial processes for energy production more sustainable. Technological innovations are also improving assimilation of vast amounts of data and information generated using a variety of platforms, unthinkable a few years ago. The technology aided information integration is contributing to better operation & maintenance, improving quality and management of water resources, thereby fostering their sustainable use and lasting resilience. But what is the global state of play for these issues? Are we inclusive and open in the process? What are the bigger questions? Is the science of hydrology and the data science or AI coevolving? What can be done to bring harmony between the two streams of sciences?',

        Abstract:'Water related challenges, such as a secure water supply, floods, droughts, and ensuring ecosystem protection and conservation, are growing concerns. Water is consistently identified as one of the highest global risks in terms of impact. These challenges already affect tens of millions of people with estimated costs in the order of magnitude of billions of US dollars and are expected to intensify with future climate change, population growth and increasing economic activities. One of the significant challenges facing societies trying to effectively manage their water resources is a lack of hydrological information products that are targeted to serve the needs of different sectors. This information deficiency is often driven by three key factors: 1) insufficient available of local scale data, 2) a lack of regional to global coherence in hydrological information and modelling systems, and 3) limited dialogue between stakeholders and the multitude of actors which renders the understanding of stakeholders needs regarding the management of water resources unclear. Because of these shortfalls, water managers and stakeholders cannot properly assess the availability of water resources on different spatio-temporal scales nor can they foresee how this availability might change over the near future, thus rendering water management and planning difficult, if not impossible. This talk will focus on current techniques and capabilities for producing sub seasonal to seasonal hydrological outlooks. It will consider what advances are needed to improve the reliability and skill in these outlooks. Lastly, it will consider the difficulties in translating the outlook into actionable messages for stakeholders.',

        SeminarTitle:'Recent Advances in Himalayan Glaciology',
        DateTime:'21 February 2020 (Friday), 4:00pm',
        Platform:'Lecture Hall, ICWaR',
        AboutSpeaker:'Dr Kulkarni is currently working as a Distinguished Scientist at Divecha Centre for Climate Change, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. He is instrumental in developing numerous remote sensing-based methods and models to understand Himalayan Cryosphere. These are widely used to map seasonal snow cover, glacier cover and moraine-dammed lakes. Further, these also are used to estimate glacier mass balance, stream runoff and to understand the influence of climate change on the Himalayan cryosphere. During his initial investigations, Dr. Kulkarni developed a methodology to map Himalayan glaciers using remote sensing data. This methodology was used to prepare glacier inventory of Indian Himalaya, providing information about the distribution of Himalayan glaciers, not available previously to the scientific community.  Dr Kulkarni and his team have recently developed a model based on velocity, slope and flow law to estimate the distribution of ice-thickness. This is being used to estimate glacier stored water and mass loss for Himalayan glaciers.  In addition, he is working on modelling Glacier Lake Outburst Floods in Himalaya. He also organises two weeks of training programs on Glaciology. Due to his significant contribution in the field of glaciology, he received numerous awards such as National Geosciences award, Polar science and cryosphere and team leader award from ISRO.',
        Abstract:'Himalayan mountain range is one of the major Water Tower of Asia and stores a large concentration of snow and glaciers.  Water Towers generate more runoff due to high orographic precipitation and delay release due to storage as snow and Ice. Therefore, water is supplied during the hot and dry season, making many rivers like Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra perennial.  Indus River considered more vulnerable under future climate change scenarios due to large contribution from snow/glacier melt, large population, high water stress and geopolitical conditions.  In addition, the livelihood of large Himalayan mountain communities also depends on the availability of water from snow and glacier melt. Therefore, periodic assessment of the state of the Himalayan cryosphere is important. In this lecture, I will give a current understanding of Himalayan cryosphere and future challenges. Recently numerous new techniques and models have been developed to estimate glacier volume, mass loss, potential glacier lake sites, assessment of flash flood from Glacier Lake Outburst Flood and effect of climate change of glacier distribution. I will discuss the significance of these contributions and its impact of water security and livelihood on mountain communities.'

He is the PI of the ATCHA project (http://www6.inrae.fr/atcha/) focused on the adaptation of Indian agriculture to climate change.',
        Abstract:'In the time of Anthropocene, global changes are questioning the capacity of the planet Earth to sustain the development of human societies in the long term. In the past two decades, this concern has fostered world wise efforts to develop integrated studies of the “Critical Zone” (CZ), the thin layer of the Earth surface, from the top of the canopy to the bottom of the aquifer, hosting the continental biosphere and providing basic human needs such as water, food, energy and ecosystem services. Critical Zone Observatories (CZO) have been set up in various climatic, geologic and human contexts with a wide range of variables being monitored on the long term. Their main challenge is to ensure the actual integration of the multiple scientific disciplines at stake, from geosciences and biological sciences to social sciences, working within a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Using experiences from France and India, this seminar will illustrate how such integration can produce the knowledge required for effectively addressing environmental issues in agricultural landscapes.'

        Abstract:'The management of water and wastewater is often seen as an institutional issue. Yet in the case of India there are many stakeholders at play apart from institutions and in fact, may crucially be using and in control of more waters and wastewaters than the government. In the quest for sustainable management of resources, optimality is put forward as a goal, whereas a series of sub optimality’s, often in conflict with the optimal, is likely the way forward. How is rainwater harvesting to work in non-optimal worlds? How is groundwater to be used and recharged? What happens to faecal sludge from pit toilets and septic tanks and wastewater in a city ecosystem? Can livelihoods also be included as part of the management of water as a resource? Do policies and standards need a fresh look in this context? Why are we subject to the tyranny of small decisions ?'

        Abstract:'Hydrologic science has undergone transformative changes over the past 100 years, from early empirical approaches to rigorous approaches based on the fluid mechanics of water movement on and below the land surface. Challenged by limitations of traditional Newtonian approaches, and embracing a Darwinian, co-evolutionary Earth system science perspective, the pursuit of hydrologic science is now guided by altogether new questions and methodologies, with a particular focus on interactions and feedbacks between parts of the Earth system that co-evolve, giving rise to the adoption of comparative hydrology. In the emergent Anthropocene, this co-evolutionary view has expanded to involve feedbacks with human-social processes as well. Hydrologic science is now entering a globalization era with a focus on new phenomena that emerge from regional and global teleconnections of the expansion of the human footprint, calling for the adoption of novel Wegenerian approaches to understand the Earth system and the role of water in it. In this lecture, I will present key milestones in the transformation of hydrologic science from Engineering Hydrology to Earth System Science.'

        Abstract:' The hydrologic cycle is an integral part of the whole Earth system, converting substantial amounts of energy. These conversions follow the laws of thermodynamics, which set the directions and impose fundamental limits, yet these also result in interactions and feedbacks that emphasise the need for an Earth system perspective.  In this talk, I provide the background for this thermodynamic description of the hydrologic cycle and use examples to show how thermodynamic limits in combination with a formulation of the dominant interactions can be used to describe the emergent behaviour.  I show how this approach can be used to provide simple, yet physically-based estimates of evaporation and how hydrologic cycling responds to global climate change.  I close with an outlook on potential future applications, highlighting the generality of the approach as energy, its conversions into other forms, and interactions are  at the very core of literally every Earth system process.'

        Abstract:'Karnataka Geographic Information System (K-GIS) is a flagship program of the state which is visualized as a geospatial technology platform that ensures availability of updated “GIS ready data” of specified standard.  It is a novel initiative by the Karnataka State Remote Sensing Applications Centre (KSRSAC) to map and integrate all department asset data and make it available for both government and public through a single gateway i.e., K-GIS Portal (https://kgis.ksrsac.in/kgis/). The datasets are organized and standardized such that they are readily available, easily-usable “integrated” GIS content for the entire state.  The major activities of K-GIS are mapping and geo-tagging of departmental and public assets, integration of MIS data and developing GIS based Decision Support System to address the spatial challenges of Government of Karnataka (GoK) departments.  Till date more than 18 lakhs asset related information was collected and organized in 350 spatial layers and the activity is growing.  By using these spatial data around 40-45 GIS based mobile applications (Ex: Moulya, Dishaank, Chunavana, Data Collector etc.,) and around 50-55 GIS based web applications (Ex: Agriculture Dept, Family Welfare Dept, Education Dept etc.,) were developed and rolled out for department and citizen usage. It has also tailored the departmental applications with GIS content for taking decisions, tracking project implementation, monitoring progress and policy definition.  Due to its implementation by GoK, all the government institute/infrastructure data and MIS information is available to the citizens, thus facilitating the Right to Information in a user-friendly manner. The maps are also available as a service to IT enthusiast and researcher to carryout research and development activities.'

        Abstract:'Groundwater is the lifeline of drinking, irrigation and industrial water supply in India. With an extraction of ~ 250 km3 annually, India are the largest user of Groundwater in the world. Though a plethora of government documents and policy papers highlighting planned and coordinated extraction management of groundwater resources is available, in practice, it has been hardly followed. So is the case of artificial recharge, often referred as medicine of all groundwater woos but mostly being executed in a segmented and unplanned manner often divested with scientific understanding of the area. Groundwater extraction has never been planned in conjunction with its annual recharge. The reason is the lack of structured approach by the Government. We use more than 85% of our extracted groundwater for irrigation through ~ 22 million wells owned by farmers. In absence of any regulatory mechanism, coupled with sops offered by the State Govts, mainly in the form of energy subsidy, has initiated a reckless extraction, creating havoc. The latest estimates reveal that about 20% of the assessment units are either overexploited or are alarmingly close to it. Artificial recharge and rain water harvesting is considered as a panacea for groundwater depletion. The Centre and State Government Departments spend huge public money mainly through various schemes like MNGREGS. The recharge structures are hardly dovetailed with local aquifer understanding, thus lacking in two basic arenas, location and design, and resulting in sub-optimal benefits. The other important issue is the lack of source water, which is primarily monsoon runoff in India. In arid and semi-arid areas, dearth of source water is a major challenge. Inter-basin water transfer should also considered for recharging the depleted aquifer. Moreover, because of climate change, the monsoon pattern is changing. The traditional understanding of types of structures and their designs needs to be revisited to accommodate and withstand high intensity rainfall.There are areas where acute groundwater mining has rendered such a condition that even if all possible recharge measures are successfully implemented and working, the resource would continue to deplete. Such a situation warrants strict direct or indirect regulation of extraction. The NAQUIM outputs are enhancing our knowledge and understanding of the prolific as well as depleted aquifer systems. The time has come to think of mega recharge schemes in hydrogeologically suitable areas.'

Dr. Deshpande’s research is focused on understanding the complex hydro-geological and hydro-meteorological processes using stable and radioactive isotopes as a tracer tool. His research in the field of Isotope Hydrology is well-known in India and abroad. He carried out a Regional Aquifer System analyses in the North Gujarat Cambay region to explain the temperature and helium anomalies in the groundwater vis-à-vis tectonic frame work of the region. He has explained the origin and distribution of high levels of fluoride in ground waters of North Gujarat and suggested remedial measures against the endemic fluorosis. He has assigned radio-carbon and Helium accumulation ages to ground waters of Gujarat and shown that groundwater being exploited today in the water stressed areas was recharged several tens of thousands of years old. This highlighted the need for artificial recharge and rain water harvesting. He observed for the first time the kinetic isotope fractionation during liquid condensation under supersaturated condition. He has identified the zones of groundwater helium anomalies along the Narmada lineament as a signature of active hydrothermal circulation.

        Abstract:'The contemporary hydrology is faced with great challenges of known problems and the greater of unknowns. Problems of water scarcity, anthropogenic pollution, geogenic contamination, dwindling surface flows, inequitable distribution and salinity ingression have turned cliché in hydrology community. The scientific processes underlying these hydrological problems are quite well understood and can be mitigated by appropriate field measures, treatment technologies, improved water use efficiency and policy interventions enforced with strong political will. While we grapple with these known water resource problems, there lies beyond a mind-boggling ignorance about certain aspects of functioning of hydrological systems, their natural course and response to perturbing stimuli. This ignorance about certain hydrological processes does not hinder the ongoing efforts of mitigating existing problems; therefore, it is presently on the back-burner. However, for a fundamental hydrology researcher, this ignorance defines the frontier of research. Filling these hydrological knowledge gaps will become essential in the coming decades to face the imminent scenario. This knowledge gap may seem only academic in nature at present but is bound to have societal implications. Some of the important questions in the above backdrop are: (1) What is the relative contribution of Western Disturbances and Indian Summer Monsoon in Himalayan precipitation, rivers and cryosphere? (2)  How are wetlands in Northeast India participating in monsoon rainfall? (3) How to identify signatures of static groundwater being circulated into the surface and atmospheric components of hydrology? (4) How much of submarine groundwater discharge can be tapped without damaging marine ecology? (5) Are there deep sources of self-recharging and self-replenishing groundwater (seawater distillate or otherwise) other than static water? (6) What is the contribution of recycled moisture in Indian precipitation? (7) How to perceive the effect of varying Himalayan riverine influx in the Bay of Bengal? (8) Can the Bay of Bengal surface water cool below threshold temperature for feeding moisture? These and many more questions define the frontier of basic research in hydrology which can be defined only by multitude of tools and expertise in conjunction with each other. Isotope application is one such tool which can play an important role in this basic research pursuit. Progress hitherto and the possibilities will be discussed in the seminar.'

        Abstract:'India is one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. However, despite an appreciable increase in funding for water research, high-quality science, that is usable by stakeholders remains elusive.There is an urgent need for “use-inspired” research on questions that actually matter to stakeholders, trans-disciplinary research, and empirical primary data on fundamental science questions. But what does such research entail? What do we understand, what questions still remain to be answered? Finally, how does science actually translate into policy and practice? What are the policy levers or game changers and how do we ensure that scientific research actually informs efforts to adopt them.'

        AboutSpeaker:'Dr. Purnima Jalihal is a senior scientist who heads the Energy and Fresh Water group in the National Institute of Ocean Technology, India.  She has coordinated many first – ever projects in ocean energy and desalination.  She has jointly coordinated the world’s first  ever ocean thermal gradient based desalination plant at Kavaratti island in the Lakshadweep group  in the Arabian Sea which has helped transform the lives of the small island community which had a serious lack of drinking water.  For this work she was awarded the Vishwakarma Medal in 2006 by the Indian National Science Academy.   This success led to more plants in islands and a demonstration plant offshore. Dr. Purnima is now attempting to scale up the technology and power such plants using ocean renewable energies.  She has several firsts in the area of ocean energy as well, including a wave powered desalination system at  Kerala, a wave powered navigational buoy and a hydrokinetic turbine. Her areas of specialization include offshore structures, floating and structural dynamics, renewable ocean energies and desalination.She has MS and  PhD degrees in Civil Engineering from Duke University , USA.   She is currently working on a large scale desalination project at Tuticorin thermal power station using the condenser reject heat and a self powered thermal desalination at Lakshadweep   using the power generated from the temperature gradient. Additionally, she played a pivotal role is getting Cabinet’s approval for India to become Member Country of the International Energy Agency’s Ocean Energy Systems (IEA-OES) Technology Collaboration Program (TCP) with the NIOT as the participating agency in 2016 and held the first Ex Co meeting in India in November 2017.',
        Abstract:'The current scenario where water stress dominates most of the regions in India warrants new technological solutions for fresh water generation.  Desalination has been on the horizon for some decades now due to large plants in the Gulf.  There are several types of desalination methods predominantly thermal and membrane based.  The technical challenges include proper methods for intake and discharge of seawater, optimization of thermodynamic parameters for thermal systems, chemicals and bye products for membrane methods and energy requirement optimization. The location, water quality and environmental impact and other parameters like availability of steam all need to be considered for appropriate selection of the desalination method.  Desalination of brackish water as well as seawater promises to be a good solution to the water crisis.  Desalination methods are energy intensive and towards lower carbon footprint, use of renewable energy forms need further exploration and development.  Cost and energy reduction for thermal technologies and safe disposal of by products for membrane methods is the need of the hour.'

        Abstract:'Karnataka state is highly vulnerable to drought. In the last 13 out of 16 years (2002-2018), most parts of Karnataka has been subjected to severe drought. The successive drought condition has resulted in shortage of water for drinking, irrigation, etc. Also, groundwater levels are depleting and quality of water is getting deteriorated. Most important component in management of drought is related to weather system – its monitoring, forecasting and adopting. Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) has taken proactive measures and has built a robust mechanism with a multi-disciplinary approach to provide Science and Technology based solution to tackle drought in Karnataka. The state-of-the-art ICT tools are being used extensively at the level of data collection, converting data into information, identifying and mapping vulnerable areas, forecast-alert-advisory dissemination to the end-user. KSNDMC has designed and installed a dense network of Solar Powered & GPRS enabled Telemetric Rain Gauge (TRG) stations covering all the 6425 Grampanchayaths (~25 sq km each) and Telemetric Weather Station (TWS) at all the 747 Hoblis (~250 sq km each) and 173 micro-watersheds to collect data and information on factors triggering drought or flood. . The weather data thus collected at every 15 minutes through these weather monitoring stations, analyzed at near-real time, maps and reports are being generated and disseminated to the customized users through auto-mode. The necessary web-applications has been developed in-house. The customized alerts/early warnings, weather information, forecast and advisories are being disseminated through email, SMS, dynamic web-portal, social media, electronic and print media. The weather related information, forecast and advisories are disseminated directly to the farmers, through interactive help-desk “VARUNA MITRA” on 24 x 7 basis. It is helping the farmers to plan their agricultural activities, minimize the crop loss due to any weather aberration. The initiatives taken up by KSNDMC have been helping the stakeholders for planning and executing drought mitigation measures at micro-level, to adopt resilient agriculture practice and efficient water management techniques.'

She specializes in changes to hydrologic systems from urban development, with a focus on interactions between groundwater, streams, stormwater, and landscape irrigation. She recieved her Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering from University of Maryland, Baltimore County.',
        Abstract:'Urban development consists of a collection of processes that have variable effects on water budgets, groundwater recharge, and stream flow flow.  Some of the processes that were focused on in this seminar are infiltration of storm water, changes to evapotranspiration, lawn irrigation, water supply pipe leakage, impervious surface cover, and infiltration of groundwater into wastewater pipes.  The methods used to investigate these drivers of urban base flow have been data analysis, field data collection, and mathematical modeling. Watershed-scale storm water infiltration was implemented as part of low impact development in a watershed that was converted to suburban development in Clarksburg, Maryland, USA.  Stream base and total flow both were found to increase during development, relative to flow in reference urban and forested watersheds.  The driving processes are suggested to be a reduction in vegetative cover and evapotranspiration, and an increase in focused groundwater recharge with watershed-scale storm water infiltration.  In Baltimore, Maryland, USA, water supply pipe leakage and impervious surface cover were found to be less important drivers of subsurface storage compared to infiltration of groundwater into wastewater pipes. Current work on drivers of urban base flow focusing on semi-arid areas were discussed.'

        'Venue':'ICWaR Seminar Hall',
        Abstract:'The talk sheds light on the critical yet often overlooked hazards posed by submerged flow regimes downstream of hydraulic structures, especially during flood events. Traditional design approaches for hydraulic structures often neglect the potential consequences of unanticipated water levels during floods. This study fills this gap by conducting experimental investigations to characterize submerged flow regimes downstream of a rectangular sharp-crested weir at varying slopes (0, 0.004, and 0.008) using a laboratory flume. The classical flow patterns of submerged regimes, namely impinging jet, surface wave, surface jump, and surface jet regime, were analyzed. The experiments meticulously examine water profiles and parameter variations representing surface jumps and waves, revealing insights into the mechanisms underlying these fatal traps. Notably, the observed range of t/h values (where t and h denote downstream and upstream depths above the crest of the weir) at which regime shifts occur varies with slope. The profiles were extracted for each submergence level to develop the correlations for various characteristics of surface jumps and waves. Captured photographs of submerged flow regime patterns at different slopes and discharge variants undergo detailed image analysis to enrich our understanding of these phenomena further and offer valuable insights into the field of submerged hydraulics.'

        Abstract:'Hydrology still lacks physics-based equations at various spatio-temporal scales. Thus, resorting to empirical equations is inevitable. These equations have to represent complex processes, which are yet to be understood properly. Thus, we sometimes end up with non-linear statistical equations with parameters to be estimated. Though expert knowledge helps to estimate the range of these parameters, estimating them from a large space (let us say you have 3 parameters with parameter space of 20, 1000, and 50 respectively, that’s 1 million parameter possibilities already!) can be a daunting task. Especially if your statistical model requires lots of computational time and resources. In this seminar I shall present a parameter estimation technique, Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with the particular type being Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis. The algorithm is a type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for random sampling. It is widely used in all kinds of fields and applications. The algorithm draws samples intuitively to converge to best possible estimate in the shortest time possible.'

        DateTime:' 01 December 2023 (Friday) at 4 PM',

        Abstract:'Recent studies indicate that hydrological models should be customized to align with distinct objectives and the basins being examined. This underscores the importance of understanding the hydrologic processes relevant to the specific objectives. In this seminar, we discuss how a sequential sensitivity analysis using the Efficient Elementary Effect (EEE) method is employed to select the sensitive parameters. The methodology is demonstrated for a highly parameterized hydrological modeling framework, SUMMA (The Structure for Unifying Multiple Modeling Alternatives). The methodology adopted not only helped to scale down the dimensionality of the problem in terms of computational demand and complexity but also allowed us to capture the dominant hydrological process of the catchment. The findings from this study align with the existing literature, thereby confirming the method’s efficacy. By giving precedence to parameters with the most substantial influence it also helps to mitigate the challenge of parameter equifinality. The potential of the method is illustrated through one of the study basins in India. The extensive model runs required are conducted through high-performance computing.'

        Abstract:'Droughts have far-reaching detrimental impacts on the environment, society, and economy, ranging from regional to national levels. As the drought characteristics are interrelated, multivariate analysis of those is necessary to understand the actual drought situation in a region. However, such studies are limited. Hence, this study aimed to develop a framework to investigate the meteorological and hydrological droughts using a multivariate analysis of drought characteristics in the Pennar River basin (a semi-arid region) of India, dominated by agricultural activity. Long-term observations (1980–2015) of precipitation, temperature, and streamflow were used to calculate the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) at a 3-month timescale. Based on these indices, drought duration, severity, and peak were abstracted using the Run Theory. The best-fit marginal distribution was determined for every drought characteristic to establish the bivariate joint probability distribution (the copula function). Based on the best-fit copula function, the joint probabilities and the joint return periods were estimated. Results revealed that, for meteorological drought, Frank Copula and Survival Clayton copula were the best-fit copula function for the joint risk of drought duration and severity and the combination of drought duration and peak as well as drought severity and peak, respectively. The joint return period of a drought event with characteristics above the 25th percentile of the same varies between 1 and 2 years, whereas it spans between 1 and 45 years for the ­ 50th percentile. This analysis will provide vital information for water management and planning in a region to mitigate droughts.'

Further, a new, improved Two-stage Decomposition method to separate the role of climate and catchment changes on streamflow is proposed, considering the uncertainty in the catchment parameter that further leads to a range of evaporative index values within a catchment.',

        DateTime:'23 March 2023 (Thursday) at 5 PM',
        'Venue':'ICWaR Seminar Hall',
        Abstract:' Carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of the net (NPP) to gross primary productivity (GPP), is a valuable metric to examine the extent of atmospheric carbon sequestered by vegetation into biomass. Evaluating CUE is essential for policymakers to devise future carbon sequestration policies and identify hotspots of carbon storage loss. Indian ecosystems face pronounced weather variability across the year. However, the role of weather variability, spatial patterns, temporal dynamics, and resilience to hydroclimatic perturbations of CUE in Indian terrestrial ecosystems remains poorly understood, particularly at sub-annual scales. The lack of sub-annual NPP datasets hinders remote sensing-based sub-annual CUE assessments, but this study derived an 8-day scale NPP dataset through an empirical formulation performed on moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. This study assesses CUE dynamics for India across its six homogeneous meteorological regions (HMRs) and the major biomes of each HMR, including croplands, forests, and grasslands, through a fine-scale remote sensing approach for 2000-2021. The results show pronounced variability of CUE across spatiotemporal scales governed by the water availability-temperature interplay. Distinct patterns were observed among the biomes, depending on the HMRs dictated by the land management practices of the regions. The study also derived sustainability maps of carbon stocks for India from the trend-persistence interplay of CUE, revealing alarming concerns across most HMRs. A severe loss of resilience of carbon stocks was observed, primarily driven by increased precipitation, and warming among meteorological drivers and soil and atmospheric drying among aridity drivers. Overall, this study highlights the critical role of CUE in assessing the carbon sequestration potential of Indian ecosystems and the need for a better understanding of the factors that influence it to develop effective carbon sequestration policies.',

        Abstract:': Rainfall-runoff model using one or more Tanks as a conceptual representation of input-storage-output systems for hydrological processes is extremely popular and has been widely used in significant parts of the world, notably in Asia. The present study is focused on the development and application of the Tank model to the Malaprabha basin, which is in the semi-arid region of Karnataka State, India. The novelty of the present research is that the Tank models were developed using Simulink, an extension of MATLAB is a graphics-based model development environment for system modeling and simulation. In the present analysis, models with 1, 2, and 3 tanks were created and applied to the Malaprabha basin using rainfall and climate data as inputs. Calibration and validation of the models were performed using observed streamflow records at the outlet of the basin. Various statistics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), the coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and percent bias error (PBIAS) were used to evaluate the relative performances of the three model formulations in simulating total runoff at daily, monthly and annual time steps. Sensitivity analysis showed that the maximum contribution to total runoff occurred from the deepest tank, indicating the importance of groundwater contribution to runoff in the Malaprabha basin. The study demonstrates the potential for Simulink to serve as an important tool in the development and application of conceptual hydrological models.',

        Abstract:'Dopamine is a catecholamine that is an essential neurotransmitter in the human body. Thus, even a minute variation in its concentration and metabolism leads to severe neurological damage or diseases such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, Schizophrenia, and many more. It could be prevented at some scale by early detection. Nanoparticles have a remarkable ability to be used in sensors for detection purposes. This study synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles for dopamine detection, accompanied by the enzyme tyrosinase used as a sensing material. The structural characterization of the nanoparticles and their interaction with dopamine via fluorescence spectroscopy was done to determine the sensitivity. The sensing material showed a selective response to dopamine and no response to interfering analytes like ascorbic acid, cysteine, and tyrosine. The limit of detection (LOD) of dopamine is observed to be 5 µM. This study indicates that sensing material can be a probe for detecting dopamine. This material is further used to develop electrochemical or solid-state sensors.',

        Abstract:'Global vegetation acts as a significant atmospheric carbon sink by converting atmospheric carbon dioxide to biomass. The efficiency of this conversion is termed the vegetation carbon use efficiency (CUE). It quantifies the carbon storage as useful biomass in the vegetation. It is defined as the net to gross primary productivity (NPP/GPP) ratio. CUE assessment is vital for policymakers as it helps plan future carbon sequestration strategies. Earlier studies have depicted the variation of CUE either using process-based models or satellite data for annual temporal scale (Chen and Yu, 2019, Sci Rep; El Masri et al., 2019, Sci Rep). Another study depicted the driving role of climatic factors on the CUE globally (He et al., 2018, Agr Forest Meteorol). However, the impact of meteorological, vegetation, aridity, and anthropogenic factors on the CUE of India’s terrestrial ecosystems at sub-annual (seasonal, sub-seasonal transitional, and monthly) temporal scales is seldom addressed. This study utilizes the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products of GPP and the net photosynthesis to produce CUE of India’s terrestrial ecosystems at the finer temporal scales (relative to annual scale), i.e., for the four seasons of India (winter, summer, monsoon, post-monsoon), the sub-seasonal transitions (wet and dry season transitions), and the twelve months. We analyze the CUE variation at the spatial scales of the country, homogeneous meteorological regions, provinces, land classes, and the Koppen climate zones from 2000 to 2021. We further discriminate the relative impacts of each environmental driver on the CUE variation of India’s terrestrial ecosystems at these spatial and temporal scales. This study demonstrates the emergent responses of the carbon storage dynamics of Indian terrestrial ecosystems to its environmental drivers and can guide policymakers in ecological restoration.',

        Abstract:'Extensive industrial pollution, agricultural runoff, and disposal of untreated sewage into the river have made Kanpur the most critical water pollution hotspot of the Ganga River. This study assesses the water quality with climate change for the mid and end of the 21st century and the resulting risk of low water quality, eutrophication, and fish kill in this industrialized stretch passing through Kanpur. For this assessment, climate projections from an ensemble of 20 GCMs for the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios are used to drive a hydrological model HEC-HMS coupled with the water quality model QUAL2K. The water quality parameters considered are dissolved oxygen, BOD, ammonia, nitrate, total nitrogen, organic, inorganic, total phosphorous, and faecal coliform. The simulation results show water quality degradation in the mid-21st century, improved by the end of the 21st century due to increased streamflow. The risk of eutrophication and fish kill is found to increase with climate change due to the more occurrence of low flow events.',

        Abstract:'Monsoon low-pressure systems (LPS) during the summer monsoon season (June-September) over India are a lifeline for the agriculture-dependent country. We use the Community Earth System Model (CESM1.2.2) to simulate the LPS characteristics (genesis, propagation direction, tracks, intensity, and precipitation) over India and the Bay of Bengal and analyze the influence of Southeast Asian mountains (SAMs) on these characteristics. CESM reproduced most of the LPS characteristics. However, a southward latitudinal shift of about 4° is simulated in the median of the tracks, which is likely due to the weaker simulated upper tropospheric meridional temperature gradient (MTG) in the Indian region. Removal of SAMs is found to have little influence on LPS characteristics. Further, it causes only a slight reduction in mean summer monsoon precipitation (by 5%) and LPS related precipitation (from 10.7±1.0 to 10.3±0.8 mm/day) over India, as SAMs have negligible influence on in-situ westward propagating LPS which are the major contributors to LPS related precipitation. The insensitivity of LPS characteristics and precipitation over India to the removal of SAMs can be attributed to their low height and the insensitivity of MTG to the height of these mountains.',

        Abstract:'Forecasting near real-time water availability in reservoirs helps in effective water resources management, flood control, hydropower generation, irrigation, and drought mitigation. The conceptual framework is built around a deep tech exercise encompassing artificial intelligence, deep-learning, water physics, hydrological science, and geoinformatics, alongside an innovative interdisciplinary approach. The predictive modelling exercise yields meaningful results when it is complemented with human understanding of the physical processes in the river basin. This is achieved by combining machine learning and hydrological modelling. Three deep learning architectures have been used – fully connected deep neural network, long short-term memory network, and WaveNets. They take inputs such as storage, inflow, outflow, and precipitation leading up to the reservoir and use these inputs to predict the inflow and storage level 30, 60 and 90 days ahead. The visualization and dissemination of the results of this exercise and other critical hydro-meteorological datasets are done through an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders make informed decisions.',

        Abstract:'Ozonation is currently considered as one of the most effective microbial disinfection technologies due to its powerful disinfection capacity. The solubility of ozone gas in water is limited, once dissolved, aqueous ozone engages in complex chemistry that includes auto-decomposition reaction with various constituents in water, in addition to reaction with microorganisms. The two widely accepted mechanism of aqueous ozone chemistry include Hoigne, Staeholin and Bader mechanisms and Gordan, Tomiyasn and Fukuton mechanisms. In efforts to meet drinking water regulations and to be cost-effective, it is required to optimize ozone dosage for disinfection. Therefore, there is a need to develop a robust and flexible tool to accurately describe ozone disinfection processes which can aid in design and operation. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has come into use recently for evaluating disinfection systems. A multiphase CFD model is developed to analyze the efficiency of ozone disinfection technology used in treatment of greywater in Berambadi primary school located in Berambadi village (rural Karnataka). The mass transfer of ozone species from gas into water is modeled using the Two-Film theory developed by Lewis and Whitman (1924). While the microbial inactivation kinetics by ozone reaction is modeled using the Hom-Haas Model. Transport equations for ozone mass transfer and reactions are incorporated to the multiphase CFD model (with the grey water as the primary phase and ozone as secondary phase). The developed multiphase CFD model is planned to be validated by comparing the numerical and experimental local ozone residual concentrations.',

        Abstract:'With the increasing population of India, not only is there a growing stress on the water resources of the country but also there is a need to increase the crop yield throughout the nation. Due to these reasons, there is a pressing need to switch to water-saving irrigation practices in the water-stressed climates of semi-arid dryland ecosystems of India. The transformation from flood irrigation to drip and sprinkler irrigation is one such method by which the water- use efficiency of irrigation systems has increased. Also, to cater to the needs of increasing population, there is a requirement to increase the crop yield by either intensifying irrigation or switching to high yielding varieties of crops. These transformations are expected to play a huge part in change in carbon fluxes from soils of these regions. Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon sink and plays an important role in carbon sequestration. Crop production through irrigation and fertilization results in the greenhouse gas emission from the soil to atmosphere. It is expected that a drip or sprinkler irrigation system would have a greater carbon footprint than a conventional flood irrigation system. This is partially attributed to the carbon emission during their manufacturing and partially to the heterogeneous and under saturated state of soil. There is a definite gap in understanding the soil carbon fluxes from the irrigation fields of semi-arid ecosystems in India. In this seminar, I wish to discuss a few methods by which the soil carbon fluxes from a heterogeneous agro-ecosystem of India present in the semi-arid climate can be addressed.',

        Abstract:'Weathering of continental silicate rock consumes  and supply cation to oceans and thereby modulating both climate and sea water chemistry (Raymo et. al., 1988). A series of secondary reactions dominate the transport of these cation from the weathering site to their point of release in oceans. These secondary reactions which lead to the formation of authigenic clay minerals thus acts as a controller of cation flux to the oceans (Misra and Froelich, 2012). The neoformed clays within the fluvial and oceanic system act as a sink for the soluble cation, thus playing a significant role in the global riverine and oceanic elemental budgets. The release of  due to clay mineral formation is in contrast to silicate weathering that acts as a net sink of  and is hence, termed Reverse weathering (Mackenzie and Garrels, 1966). Reverse weathering not only plays a critical role in the geochemical cycling of elements it also modulates the global carbon cycle. In this seminar I am going to discuss some aspects of reverse weathering and the ways to study the same in Indian riverine systems where in recent years heavy metal concentration have been on the rise because of anthropogenic activity.',

        Abstract:'The Brahmaputra River suffers a dramatic change in elevation before it enters India along the eastern syntaxis where it exhumes large amounts of sediments which it eventually deposits along the plains of Assam and Bangladesh. This river system is one of the largest in the world with a high specific discharge and experiences several long-duration floods during monsoon, causing enormous damage to infrastructure, agriculture and livelihood of the inhabitants of low-lying areas in the flood plains. Physical studies carried out on the Brahmaputra river basin have utilised a single hydrological model to simulate the daily discharge. Relying on a single model often leads to predictions that capture some phenomena at the expense of others. Multi-model ensemble hydrological simulation has been an effective method for improving simulation accuracy. Geochemical characteristics related to the major ion chemistry and radioisotope systematics in this river have been previously studied, but none of these studies has focussed on using geochemistry to study flood events that occur annually in the Brahmaputra. The aim is to simultaneously dwell on the physical and geochemical characteristics of the river basin. This enables one to address and investigate questions based on geochemical attributes that may otherwise not be answered using a purely physical modeling approach.',

        Abstract:'The world is currently in a highly water stressed situation, with 844 million people around the globe with no access to clean water. By 2050, it is estimated that 5.7 billion people in the world will have to live in areas  plagued by water scarcity (UN, 2013). The availability of safe drinking water in sufficient quantity is directly linked with how wastewater is managed. In India, about 38671 MLD of untreated sewage is discharged into waterbodies rendering these water sources unfit for use. To prevent contamination of natural water bodies and to achieve water sustainability, there is a need to value wastewater for its potential rather than discard it. Membrane bioreactor (MBR) has emerged as one of the leading technologies for treatment of both municipal and industrial wastewater due to efficiency in producing high quality effluents. There have been several modelling studies focusing on the biological processes and the hydrodynamics aspects of membrane bioreactor. Biokinetic models including the Activated sludge models, Hybrid models and integrated models is used to understand and capture the complexities of the biological processes in MBR. The Hydrodynamic models including Computational Fluid dynamics models (CFD) focus on MBR system design and optimization. A multiphase CFD model is developed to investigate the efficiency of the aeration system in the Membrane Bioreactor. The turbulence in the Bioreactor is modeled using k-є model and the diffusion of oxygen in water from aeration system is modeled using species transport model. The developed CFD model is also validated using existing literature experimental results.',

        Abstract:'Every year India suffers from floods triggered by Monsoon Low pressure Systems (LPS), which cause disastrous effects at many locations in the country. In the past, a few studies developed procedures for identifying genesis points of LPS and algorithms for tracking their propagation. They were used on various reanalysis products to determine tracks of LPS originating in the Indian subcontinent. But none of those procedures are proven to be effective in predicting the interannual variability of LPS frequency observed by India Meteorological Department (IMD). Questions also arise on the subjectivity involved in the manual procedure (based on pressure charts) considered by IMD for detection of LPS tracks. Inconsistency also exists in future projections of these systems by various studies. Results obtained from investigations performed on different approaches to examine these issues would be presented.',

        Abstract:'The quantification of runoff and base flow components of hydrograph in terms of water fluxes and chemical composition is an important issue in catchment hydrology. Particularly in a riverine system contribution of hydrograph components depends on the initial state of the various hydrological reservoirs and on the characteristics of the hydrological input (precipitation). Baseflow reacts slowly to precipitation and is usually associated with water discharged from groundwater storage. By separating the baseflow (pre-event water) from the stream discharge the contribution of surface and groundwater can be quantified using stable isotope tracers. The stable isotopes of water namely 18O and 2H, which are part of the water molecule, are typically considered in the hydrological investigations owing to their spatio-temporal variations resulting from isotope fractionations along different phase changes of water cycle and diffusion. Various atmospheric processes such as advection, condensation and evaporation directly impact the composition of stable water isotope, which consequently influence the groundwater isotopic composition. As a part of the Isotope Hydrograph Separations (IHS), study has been done for Kabini catchment by applying end member mixing analysis (EMMA) to quantify the pre-event water and event water.',

Other major factors affecting water quality are the point and non-point sources of pollution which include industrial & municipal sewage discharge and agricultural runoff. Due to climate change, there can be deterioration of water quality even if the effluent discharged is within permissible limits. Objective of the study is to quantify the response of water quality due to climate change, and to identify hotspots of pollution in the Ganga River. Water quality analysis is carried out using a water quality model QUAL2K. The impact of climate change is assessed using 2 methods: hypothetical scenarios of temperature & stream flow and temperature outputs of GCMs for various RCP scenarios as input to water quality model.',
